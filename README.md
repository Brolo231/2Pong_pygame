# Pong_pygame
Pong is a two player game that I created using python and Pygame. It is an imitation of the original 1970s game, Pong, which was one of the first ever video games created and ultimately paved the way for video game design. My version of Pong has the same play style as the original Pong game mixed with the ability for local co-op.
